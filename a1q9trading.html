<P>With its massive population and bustling economy, India is an engine of growth. On Jan. 22, 2024, its stock market capitalization surpassed Hong Kongâ€™s for the first time. According to data compiled by Bloomberg, the value of shares listed on Indian exchanges reached $4.33 trillion, compared to $4.29 trillion for Hong Kong.
    India has two primary stock markets, the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange (NSE).
    The BSE is India's oldest stock exchange.
    India's exchanges are regulated by the Securities Exchange Board of India (SEBI).
    The two prominent Indian market indexes are Sensex and Nifty.
    The BSE and NSE
    Most of the trading in the Indian stock market takes place on its two stock exchanges: the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange (NSE). The BSE was established in 1875. The NSE was founded in 1992 and started trading in 1994. Both exchanges follow the same trading mechanism, trading hours, and settlement process.
